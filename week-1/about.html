        <p>Hello! My name is Annie, and I'm a unique individual with my own passions, preferences, and personality. I enjoy expressing myself and exploring the world around me. Below, I'll share some of my favorite things—and a few things I'm not so fond of—to help you get to know me better.I'm a full-stack developer with a keyboard for a paintbrush and code for my canvas. By day, I architect digital worlds where logic meets creativity, and by night, I'm probably debugging my life with the same precision I apply to my code. Born and raised in Nigeria, I bring the resilience of Lagos traffic and the ingenuity of "African magic" to every project I touch.I speak in languages both human and machine—JavaScript whispers sweet nothings to me, Python sings logic in rhythmic indentations, and CSS? Well, CSS and I have a love-hate relationship (mostly love… until it's not). My mind thrives in the space between problem and solution, where a missing semicolon can unravel hours of work, and a perfectly executed function feels like a standing ovation from my terminal.</p>
        <p>But I'm more than my tech stack. I'm the kind of developer who names variables like a poet—userJoy instead of userStatus, firebaseDragon instead of dbInstance. My code comments sometimes include motivational quotes (“// You got this, future Annie!”) or snack reminders (“// Pizza break after this component”).</p>
        <p>When I'm not conquering bugs, I'm probably mentoring new devs (because nobody should suffer imposter syndrome alone), obsessing over responsive designs that work even on Aunty Ngozi's ancient Nokia, or daydreaming about building an app that finally solves Nigeria's "light issue" (just kidding… unless?).</p>
